## 🚀 About the Project

In many small and medium-scale medical centers, patient queues are managed using manual paper tokens. This leads to:
* **Physical Presence Required:** Patients must visit early just to get a number.
* **Uncertain Wait Times:** No visibility on "Now Serving" numbers, causing overcrowding.
* **Administrative Burden:** Staff manually track skipped numbers and manage disputes.

**MediQ** solves these issues by providing:
* **For Patients:** Remote token requests, live queue tracking, and real-time push notifications.
* **For Doctors:** A secure dashboard to manage sessions, accept/reject requests, and control the live queue.
